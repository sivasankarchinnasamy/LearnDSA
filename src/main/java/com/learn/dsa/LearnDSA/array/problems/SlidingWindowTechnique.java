 Problem: Sliding Window Technique
 Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given an array of integers of size ‘n’.
Our aim is to calculate the maximum sum of ‘k’ 
consecutive elements in the array.

Input  : arr[] = {100, 200, 300, 400}
         k = 2
Output : 700

Input  : arr[] = {1, 4, 2, 10, 23, 3, 1, 0, 20}
         k = 4 
Output : 39
We get maximum sum by adding subarray {4, 2, 10, 23}
of size 4.

Input  : arr[] = {2, 3}
         k = 3
Output : Invalid
There is no subarray of size 3 as size of whole array is 2.

Solution:

Window Sliding Technique

The technique can be best understood with the window pane in bus, consider a window of length n and the pane which is fixed in it of length k. 
Consider, initially the pane is at extreme left i.e., at 0 units from the left. Now, co-relate the window with array arr[] of size n and pane with current_sum 
of size k elements. Now, if we apply force on the window such that it moves a unit distance ahead. The pane will cover next k consecutive elements.

Consider an array arr[] = {5, 2, -1, 0, 3} and value of k = 3 and n = 5

Applying sliding window technique :

We compute the sum of first k elements out of n terms using a linear loop and store the sum in variable window_sum.
Then we will graze linearly over the array till it reaches the end and simultaneously keep track of maximum sum.
To get the current sum of block of k elements just subtract the first element from the previous block and add the last element of the current block .

class SlidingWindowTechnique {

	// Returns maximum sum in a subarray of size k.
	static int maxSum(int arr[], int n, int k) {
		// n must be greater
		if (n < k) {
			System.out.println("Invalid");
			return -1;
		}

		// Compute sum of first window of size k
		int max_sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
			max_sum += arr[i];

		// Compute sums of remaining windows by removing first element of previous window and adding last element of current window.
		int window_sum = max_sum;
		for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
			window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
			max_sum = Math.max(max_sum, window_sum);
		}

		return max_sum;
	}

	// Driver code
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int arr[] = { 1, 4, 2, 10, 2, 3, 1, 0, 20 };
		int k = 4;
		int n = arr.length;
		System.out.println(maxSum(arr, n, k));
